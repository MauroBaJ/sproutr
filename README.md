IoT Smart Planter
___
This project will be the final assesment of my "Aplicaciones y Dispositivos IoT" class. This repository will contain the code of the WebApp where we can monitor the state of certain plant factors, such as:
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Soil Temperature and Humidity

I'm also planning to add an automatic system for watering the plant, that does that when a certain threshold of soil humidity is reached.

For the main chip I'll be using a NodeMCU ESP8266.
